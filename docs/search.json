People attempt to overcome or bypass the constraint\n\n\nEconomic actors do not passively accept constraints, they adapt or find workarounds.\n\n\n\n\nWhen things fail, agents might invest or find in alternatives\n\nThe power grid fails often, so agents invest in generators to overcome unreliable electricity\nIf crime is high, agents might invest in private security\nIf taxes are too much or unreasonable, business might shift toward cash only\n\nBy observing coping mechanisms, we can better identify what the economy’s main problems are\n\n\n\nIf agents spend a lot of effort or resources getting around certiain limitations, that limitation is likely binding"

Agents less intensive in a binding constraint are more likely to thrive\n\n\nIf a constraint is binding, agents that participate less or are less exposed to it will perform better.\n\n\n\n\nIf a contraint does not directly (or it is less prevalent) affect your action, then the agent is not as limited\n\nEx: If infrastructure is the issue, exporting firms near a port may grow faster than inland producers\nEx: If political corruption is the main concern, then agents that are politically connected will succeed while others stagnate\n\n\n\n\nThis principle checks the variation within the economy, which agents grow and which do not?\n\n\nThe presence (or absence) of thriving sectors reveals a lot about what is holding back the rest of the economy.\nWhy are the successes succeeding, and the failures failing."
