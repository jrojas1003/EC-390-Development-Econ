[What makes Development Different?]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- International setting
- Very low socioeconomic status populations
- Lots of constraints (financial, behavioral, market, institutional, etc.)
- Little social protection

- Presence of strong non-market institutions (social networks, informal markets)
- Monopolistic markets (no "perfect competition" assumptions)
- Institutional setting is widely diverse, varying from country to country
