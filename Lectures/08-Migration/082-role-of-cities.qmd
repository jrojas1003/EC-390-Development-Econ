## Role of Cities

[Cities can be thought of as a massive coordination success]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- As distance between consumers and producers increases we see:
    - Communication being more difficult
    - Transportation becomes more expensive
    - Market information is less transparent 
- [Example:]{.h}
    - Shopping for a car in Portland allows you a lot of opportunity for information
    - Shopping for a car in Tillamook can be more difficult with less information
:::

::: {.notes}
In a city like Portland, there are many car dealerships, private sellers, and online listings within a short distance. 

- Consumers can compare prices, models, and conditions easily.

- There is more competition among sellers, which encourages transparency and better deals.

- Buyers can quickly verify information and switch to another seller if needed.

In contrast, in a rural area like Tillamook:

- There are fewer sellers and dealerships, so buyers have limited options to compare.

- It takes more time and money to travel to other towns to view cars or verify prices.

- Because of this isolation, market information is less complete—buyers may not know what a “fair price” really is, and sellers face less pressure to be competitive.

## Agglomeration Economies

[Definition:]{.h} Being close to others makes production and consumption cheaper and more efficient than being isolated
