## Role of Cities

[Cities can be thought of as a massive coordination success]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- As distance between consumers and producers increases we see:
    - Communication being more difficult
    - Transportation becomes more expensive
    - Market information is less transparent 
- [Example:]{.h}
    - Shopping for a car in Portland allows you a lot of opportunity for information
    - Shopping for a car in Tillamook can be more difficult with less information
:::

::: {.notes}
In a city like Portland, there are many car dealerships, private sellers, and online listings within a short distance. 

- Consumers can compare prices, models, and conditions easily.

- There is more competition among sellers, which encourages transparency and better deals.

- Buyers can quickly verify information and switch to another seller if needed.

In contrast, in a rural area like Tillamook:

- There are fewer sellers and dealerships, so buyers have limited options to compare.

- It takes more time and money to travel to other towns to view cars or verify prices.

- Because of this isolation, market information is less complete—buyers may not know what a “fair price” really is, and sellers face less pressure to be competitive.

## Agglomeration Economies

[Definition:]{.h} Being close to others makes production and consumption cheaper and more efficient than being isolated

## The Issue of Congestion

The most [obvious form of congestion]{.hi} is [traffic]{.hp}

## Colonialism and Urban Development

- Many colonies were used [only for resource extraction]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Settlements were set up near resources or export points (coasts)
- Colonizers have [little need to build roads linking villages]{.hi}
- All roads [lead to the central city]{.hi} (usually on the coast or near bodies of water)
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Transportation routes linking industries play a key role]{.h}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Urban concentrations appear where [transport routes cross]{.hi}
- This emphasizes the lasting impacts of historical events
- When all roads lead to [one place]{.hi}, what should we expect to happen to populations of that area?

[French colony concentrated in]{.h} [Dakar]{.hi-red}
:::

![](images/senegal.PNG){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
Pre-colonial: Part of Ghana, Mali, and Jolof empires; active in gold and slave trade routes.

Early contact (15th–17th c.): Portuguese, Dutch, British, and French establish coastal posts; Saint-Louis (1659) and Gorée (1677) become French trading hubs.

French expansion (19th c.): Governor Faidherbe extends rule inland, promotes peanut exports, builds roads/railways; Four Communes gain limited citizenship.

Colonial consolidation (1900–1945): Dakar made capital of French West Africa; assimilation policies spread French language, schools, and culture.

Path to independence: Post-WWII nationalism led by Léopold Sédar Senghor → autonomy (1958) → independence (1960).

Legacy: French language, centralized administration in Dakar, and export-oriented economy remain colonial imprints.

## Urban Giantism Problems

There are many potential problems when the majority of the country lives in a [single city]{.hi}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- Obviously [congestion]{.hp} is a problem 
- But we can also experience [Urban Bias]{.h}
    - [Definition:]{.h} More resources go to cities than rural areas
- This may also lead to [political instability]{.hi}
:::

::: {.notes}
Concentration of people, power, and opportunity in a single city amplifies inequality and political tension. 

In developing countries, where institutions and service capacity are limited, this imbalance often makes urban unrest and regime instability more likely.
