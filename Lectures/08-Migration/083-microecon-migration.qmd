## Microeconomics of Migration

The [decision to migrate]{.hi} is one of [potential trade-offs]{.hp}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- Do I stay in a [rural area and try to make a living farming]{.h}?
- Do I move away [to a new place and look for work there]{.h}?
- These decisions have costs and benefits, which is why [the decision to migrate is an economic one]{.hi}
:::

## Microeconomics of Migration

[Consider an agent living in a rural area]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- The agent has a choice:
    - Work in the [rural area]{.h} (farming) and receive [wage $X per day]{.h}
    - Move to [the city and work there]{.hi} (manufacturing) and receive [wage $Y per day]{.hi}
    - Where $Y > X$
- What should the [agent do]{.h}? [Move to the city]{.hp}
:::

[But]{.hi-red .fragment .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- What if there is [no guarantee of employment]{.hp} once they move?
- Let's introduce a model that will [allow us to use this uncertainty]{.hi}

## Todaro Migration Model

[Premise:]{.h} Agents consider labor market opportunities available to them in the rural and urban sectors and choose the one that maximizes their expected gains from migration 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
[Main Assumptions]{.hi .align-center}

- Agents have knowledge of labor markets
- Migration has no cost
- Two regions to work in
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
[Two Regions]{.hi .align-center .fragment}

- Rural with [rural wage $(w^{R})$]{.h} which is flexible enough that there is [full employment]{.hi}
- City with [city wage $(w^{C})$]{.hi-teal} which is fixed
:::
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Rural: Everyone can at least work on their own farm

Urban: Consider some form of minimum wage or the need for urban employers to pay their workers a large enough wage to attract talented workers
:::

## Todaro Migration Model: Setup

::: {.fragment}
- There are a total of [N workers]{.h} in the economy

- There are [$N^{C}$]{.hi-teal} and [$N^{R}$]{.h} workers who live in the [city]{.hi-teal} and [rural]{.h} area, respectively:

[$N = N^{C} + N^{R}$]{.align-center}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- [Not all workers who live in the city are employed]{.hp}
- Populations in both areas look like:
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
\begin{align*}
    N^{C} &= L^{C} + U^{C} \\
    N^{R} &= L^{R}
\end{align*}

- where $L^{C}, U^{C},$ and $L^{R}$ are the number of city employed workers, city unemployed workers, and rural employed workers
:::

::: {.notes}
Some are [unemployed]{.hi} or [work in an informal sector]{.hi}
:::

---

## Todaro Migration Model

::: {.vertical-center}
- If we combine the previous equations we get:

[$U^{C} = N - L^{C} - L^{R}$]{.align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- We can take one step further and calculate [the unemployment rate]{.hi} as:

$$
    u^{C} = \dfrac{U^{C}}{U^{C} + L^{C}} = \dfrac{N - L^{C} - L^{R}}{N - L^{R}}
$$
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
The number of unemployed people in the city is equal to the total number of people minus the number of employed city workers minus the number of rural workers
:::

## Todaro Migration Model: Equilibrium

- Agents in the model base their migration decision on their expected income in the city

::: {.incremental}
- Even though the wage is the city is fixed, there is some probability that if the agent migrates they will be unemployed
- The [expected city wage]{.hi} is given by:

[$E(w^{C}) = \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \times w^{C} + \left( 1 - \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \right) \times 0$]{.align-center .fragment}

- [Where $\left( 1 - \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \right)$ is the probability that the agent will not find a job]{.small}
:::

::: {.notes}
Explain parts here

## Todaro Migration Model: Equilibrium

[$E(w^{C}) = \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \times w^{C}$]{.align-center}

<br><br>

[In this model, an equilibrium is a set of numbers]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Equilbirum = $(L^{C}, U^{C}, L^{R}, w^{R}, w^{C})$
- We can solve for it using graphs
- Let's try an example
:::

::: {.notes}
Second part is just zero so expected wage is just this
