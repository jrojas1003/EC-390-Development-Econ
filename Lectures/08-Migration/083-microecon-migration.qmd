## Microeconomics of Migration

The [decision to migrate]{.hi} is one of [potential trade-offs]{.hp}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- Do I stay in a [rural area and try to make a living farming]{.h}?
- Do I move away [to a new place and look for work there]{.h}?
- These decisions have costs and benefits, which is why [the decision to migrate is an economic one]{.hi}
:::

---

## Microeconomics of Migration

[Consider an agent living in a rural area]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- The agent has a choice:
    - Work in the [rural area]{.h} (farming) and receive [wage $X per day]{.h}
    - Move to [the city and work there]{.hi} (manufacturing) and receive [wage $Y per day]{.hi}
    - Where $Y > X$
- What should the [agent do]{.h}? [Move to the city]{.hp}
:::

[But]{.hi-red .fragment .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- What if there is [no guarantee of employment]{.hp} once they move?
- Let's introduce a model that will [allow us to use this uncertainty]{.hi}
:::

## Todaro Migration Model

[Premise:]{.h} Agents consider labor market opportunities available to them in the rural and urban sectors and choose the one that maximizes their expected gains from migration 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
[Main Assumptions]{.hi .align-center}

- Agents have knowledge of labor markets
- Migration has no cost
- Two regions to work in
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
[Two Regions]{.hi .align-center .fragment}

- Rural with [rural wage $(w^{R})$]{.h} which is flexible enough that there is [full employment]{.hi}
- City with [city wage $(w^{C})$]{.hi-teal} which is fixed
:::
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Rural: Everyone can at least work on their own farm

Urban: Consider some form of minimum wage or the need for urban employers to pay their workers a large enough wage to attract talented workers
:::

---

## Todaro Migration Model: Setup

::: {.fragment}
- There are a total of [N workers]{.h} in the economy

- There are [$N^{C}$]{.hi-teal} and [$N^{R}$]{.h} workers who live in the [city]{.hi-teal} and [rural]{.h} area, respectively:

[$N = N^{C} + N^{R}$]{.align-center}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- [Not all workers who live in the city are employed]{.hp}
- Populations in both areas look like:
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
\begin{align*}
    N^{C} &= L^{C} + U^{C} \\
    N^{R} &= L^{R}
\end{align*}

- where $L^{C}, U^{C},$ and $L^{R}$ are the number of city employed workers, city unemployed workers, and rural employed workers
:::

::: {.notes}
Some are [unemployed]{.hi} or [work in an informal sector]{.hi}
:::

---

## Todaro Migration Model

::: {.vertical-center}
- If we combine the previous equations we get:

[$U^{C} = N - L^{C} - L^{R}$]{.align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- We can take one step further and calculate [the unemployment rate]{.hi} as:

$$
    u^{C} = \dfrac{U^{C}}{U^{C} + L^{C}} = \dfrac{N - L^{C} - L^{R}}{N - L^{R}}
$$
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
The number of unemployed people in the city is equal to the total number of people minus the number of employed city workers minus the number of rural workers
:::

---

## Todaro Migration Model: Equilibrium

- Agents in the model base their migration decision on their expected income in the city

::: {.incremental}
- Even though the wage is the city is fixed, there is some probability that if the agent migrates they will be unemployed
- The [expected city wage]{.hi} is given by:

[$E(w^{C}) = \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \times w^{C} + \left( 1 - \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \right) \times 0$]{.align-center .fragment}

- [Where $\left( 1 - \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \right)$ is the probability that the agent will not find a job]{.small}
:::

::: {.notes}
Explain parts here
:::

---

## Todaro Migration Model: Equilibrium

[$E(w^{C}) = \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \times w^{C}$]{.align-center}

<br><br>

[In this model, an equilibrium is a set of numbers]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Equilbirum = $(L^{C}, U^{C}, L^{R}, w^{R}, w^{C})$
- We can solve for it using graphs
- Let's try an example
:::

::: {.notes}
Second part is just zero so expected wage is just this

## Numerical Example

Let's look at an example with numbers

[Urban Wages]{.hi-orange .align-center}

![](images/numerical-ex-02.PNG){height="450" fig-align="center"}

[Rural Wages]{.hi-green .align-center}

## Numerical Example

We want to put [both demand curves]{.h} on the same graph

::: {.fragment}
- We put [urban wages]{.hi-orange} on the right-hand side and [rural wages]{.hi-green} on the left-hand side
- Be careful to notice the difference in axis values 
    - [Urban wages]{.hi-orange} are higher than [rural wages]{.hi-green}
:::

---

## Numerical Example - Combined Demand Curves

![](images/numerical-ex-03.PNG){fig-align="center"}

---

## Numerical Example - Stage 01

::: {.vertical-center}
- Let the wage in the urban area be fixed at [10 {{< fa arrow-right >}} $(w^{C} = 10)$]{.hi}

- [Urban employers]{.hi-orange} demand [2 units of labor {{< fa arrow-right >}} $(L^{c} = 2)$]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- For now, suppose [no one migrates to the city]{.h}
    - Everyone works in the [rural sector]{.hi-green} and receives a wage of 1:
    - [$w^{R} = 1$ and $L^{R} = 8$]{.hi}
:::

[Is this an equilibrium?]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.incremental .small}
- The [$10 urban wage]{.hi-orange} is tempting for rural workers
- But there is a chance they will not get a job in the city 
- So there are still [migration dynamics]{.hi} to consider
- Let's suppose that, at first, two rural workers choose to [migrate]{.hp}
- This means there are now [4 workers in the urban area]{.hi-orange}
:::

:::

::::

---

## Numerical Example - Stage 02 (Migration)

So with 2 brave souls [migrating]{.hp} to the city, we now have [4 people in the urban area]{.hi-orange} which implies:

::: {.incremental}
- There is an [increase]{.h} in the number of people living in the [urban area]{.hi-orange}
- There is a [decrease]{.h} in the number of people living in the [rural area]{.hi-green}
- The increase in the [urban population]{.hi-orange} [reduces]{.h} the probability that an urban worker is able to find employment
- At the same time, the [reduction in the rural population]{.hi-green} [increases]{.h} [rural wages]{.hi-green}
:::

![](images/numerical-ex-05.PNG){fig-align="center"}

## Numerical Example - Finding New Wages

Recall we can find the [rural wage]{.hi-green} by:

$$
    w^{R} = \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \times w^{C}
$$

::: {.fragment}
- We know that $L^{C} = 2, N = 10, L^{R} = 6$ and $w^{C} = 10$
:::

::: {.fragment}
$$
    w^{R} = \dfrac{2}{10 - 6} \times 10 = 5
$$

[Is this an equilibrium?]{.hp .align-center} 

[Let's check our graph again]{.align-center}
:::

::: {.notes}
rural wages is equal to expected urban wages in equilibrium
:::

## Numerical Example - Finding New Wages

![](images/numerical-ex-05.PNG){fig-align="center"}

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[Not an equilibrium]{.hi-red}

When there are 6 people in the [rural area]{.hi-green}, the wage $w^{R}$ is 3.3
:::

::: {.notes}
Not enough people migrated to the city

Let's see what happens when 3 people migrate
:::

---

## Numerical Example - Stage 03 (3 Migrants)

![](images/numerical-ex-06.PNG){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
rural wages increase due to lower population

unemployment in the city is higher
:::

---

## Numerical Example - Stage 03 (Wages)

::: {.align-center}
If 3 people migrate, then $L^{R} = 5$ and $w^{R} = 4$
:::

- Our equilibrium condition is such that $w^{R} = E[w^{C}]$ :

\begin{align*}
    w^{R} = E[w^{C}] = \dfrac{L^{C}}{N - L^{R}} \times w^{C} = \dfrac{2}{10 - 5} \times 10 = 4
\end{align*}

::: {.incremental}
- [This is an equilibrium!]{.hi-red}
- We write this as $(L^{R} = 5, L^{C} = 2, U^{C} = 3, w^{C} = 10, w^{R} = 4)$
- Writing it like this is important: it shows that the equilibrium is a set of values
:::

::: {.notes}
The order is not important, but rather that all of them appear and have a value
:::

## Summary

::: {.incremental}
- Biggest [benefit]{.hi-green} of urbanization and migration to cities are [agglomeration economies]{.h}
- Biggest [cost]{.hi-red} of urbanization and migration is [congestion]{.h}
- Outcomes of urbanization and migration are less clear:
    - Does urbanization lead to higher social capital?
    - Does urbanization lead to more inequality and less social capital?
    - Who is able to migrate? The wealthiest? The best educated?
- Equally important is the ability of receiving cities to properly accommodate migrants
- Possibly the biggest issue surrounding urbanization in developing countries involves the lack of opportunity in rural areas

[_1._]{.hp .note} [Better Rural-Urban Balance]{.hp}

- Most policies are focused on urban sectors due to their economic and political importance
- This highlights the need for policies aimed at assisting rural workers
    - Ex: Better access to credit and insurance markets for farmers should reduce the risk of working in rural areas
