## Lewis Two-Sector Model

Was the general theory of the development process in [surplus-labor developing nations]{.hi} in the 60s and 70s

::: {.vertical-center}
- Focuses on [structural transformation]{.hp} of a primarily [subsistence economy]{.hi}

    - [_Definition:_]{.hp} A major alteration in the industrial composition of any economy
    - Usually we talk about moving from subsistence agricultural sector to manufacturing sector 
:::

---

## Model Set Up 

There is an [underdeveloped economy]{.hi} with:

::: {.fragment}
- Two Sectors

    [_1._]{.hp} A traditional, overpopulated, rural subsistence sector

    [_2._]{.hp} A high-productivity, modern, urban industrial sector
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Primary Focus
    - Process of labor transfer/movement between sectors 
    - Growth of output and employment in the [industrial]{.h} sector
:::
    
::: {.fragment}
> The transfer of labor between sectors and employment growth in the [industrial]{.h} sector is due to [expansion in the industrial sector]{.hi}
:::

---

## Industrial Sector Expansion

The speed at which the [industrial sector]{.hi} grows is determiend by [investment and capital accumulation]{.hi} in that sector 

::: {.incremental}
- Capitalists make profits in the [industrial sector]{.hi} above paid [wages]{.hi}
- Assume that they invest it [all]{.hp} back into the sector (more capital enters)
- [Capital stock]{.hi} increases and they hire more labor
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Some questions/doubts arise]{.hi}

[_1._]{.hp} Where is all the labor coming from? I thought the other side was a [subsistence agricultural sector]{.hi}?

[_2._]{.hp} I thought economists didn't believe in positive profits

[_3._]{.hp} [Capital]{.hi} only increases in the industrial sector?
:::

## Subsistence Agricutural Sector 

There are two primary assumptions to consider

::: {.vertical-center}

[_1._]{.hp} There is a [surplus of labor]{.hi} 

::: {.fragment}
- Marginal productivity of labor $(MP_{LA})$ is zero
:::

[_2._]{.hp} All [rural workers]{.hi} share their output equally 

::: {.fragment}
- Rural wages are determined by the average product of labor
:::

::: {.fragment}
- There are $L_{A}$ agricultural workers that produce $TP_{A}$ food
- They share food equally as $W_{A}$ per person

## Wage Differences

[Agricultural wages]{.hi} are lower than [wages in the industrial sector]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Supply of agricultural labor is assumed to be [perfectly elastic/unlimited]{.hi}
    - This means that at industrial wages $(W_{M})$ above agricultural wages $(W_{A})$, the industrial sector can hire [as many surplus workers as they want without fear of raising wages]{.hp}
:::

::: {.fragment}
- We assume labor to have diminishing returns (1 more labor $\neq$ 1 more output)
- The profit-maximizing industrial sector hires labor until their [marginal product]{.hi} is equal to [the real wage]{.hi}
:::

:::{.notes}
- Important to see that quantity of labor between sectors is on different scale: ag is in millions, ind is in thousands

## Investments

Because the industrial sector owners make a [positive profit]{.hi-green} and they fully reinvest those back into [capital]{.hi}

[We get self-sustaining growth]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- This will happen until all [surplus rural labor]{.hi} is absorbed into the industrial sector

- The [industrial sector]{.h} can extract additional workers [at a higher cost]{.hp} since it would now imply a loss of food production

- This is the [Lewis Turning Point]{.hp}

    - [The labor supply curve becomes [positively sloped]{.hi} in the industrial sector and wages increase in the economy]{.small}
    - [Eventually the market goes through a [structural transformation]{.hi} where it shifted from a traditional rural agricultural to a modern urban industrial setting]{.small}
