## Model 02 - Solow Growth Model

Now we can add some [important features]{.hp}

::: {.fragment .vertical-center}
- Population growth
- Technological change
- Emphasizes looking at outcomes in [per worker]{.hi} terms
::: 

---

## Solow Growth Model Assumptions

::: {.vertical-center}
[_1._]{.hp} [Output per worker $y$]{.hi} depends only on the amount of [capital per worker $k$]{.hi}

[_2._]{.hp} Every worker [saves a proportion]{.hi} $s$ of their income

[_3._]{.hp} [Population grows]{.hi} at rate $n$

[_4._]{.hp} [Capital depreciates]{.hi} at rate $\delta$

[_5._]{.hp} [Capital stock]{.hi} depends on new [investment]{.hi}
::: 

---

## Solow Growth Model Assumptions

[_1._]{.hp} [Output per worker $y$]{.hi} depends only on the amount of [capital per worker $k$]{.hi}

$$ y = f(k)$$

- $f()$ is [increasing]{.hi} (more capital leads to more output)
- $f()$ is [concave]{.hi} (decreasing returns to capital)

:::

[_5._]{.hp} [Capital stock]{.hi} depends on new [investment]{.hi}

- Every time period workers save some of their income $sf(k)$
- [However]{.hp}, capital [depreciates]{.hi} so we lose $\delta k$
- The [populations grows]{.hi} at rate $n$ so the [capital per worker]{.hi} gets smaller by $nk$

## Solow - Change in Capital per Worker

::: {.align-center}
$\Delta k$ $=$ $sf(k)$ $-$ $nk$ $-$ $\delta k$
:::

::: {.vertical-center}
- $\Delta k$: Growth of capital per worker 

- $sf(k)$: Savings  

- $nk$: Net new workers 

- $\delta k$: Capital depreciation 
:::

---

## Solow - Change in Capital per Worker

::: {.align-center}
[$\Delta k$]{.hp} [$=$ $sf(k)$ $-$ $nk$ $-$ $\delta k$]{.faded}
:::

- [$\Delta k$: Growth of capital per worker]{.hp} 

    - The more capital a worker has to work with, the more output that they can produce

    - The change in [capital per worker]{.hi} depends on the other components

::: {.faded}
- $sf(k)$: Savings  

- $nk$: Net new workers 

- $\delta k$: Capital depreciation

## Solow - Change in Capital per Worker

::: {.align-center}
[$\Delta k$]{.faded} [$=$]{.faded} [$sf(k)$]{.hp} [$-$ $nk$ $-$ $\delta k$]{.faded}
:::

::: {.faded}
- $\Delta k$: Growth of capital per worker 
:::

- [$sf(k)$: Savings]{.hp} {{< fa arrow-right >}} [(Positive)]{.hi-green}

    - Each worker saves a proportion of their income and is reinvested into ["capital in the future"]{.hi}

::: {.faded}
- $nk$: Net new workers 

- $\delta k$: Capital depreciation 
:::

## Solow - Change in Capital per Worker

::: {.faded}
- $\Delta k$: Growth of capital per worker 

- $sf(k)$: Savings 
:::

- [$nk$: Net new workers]{.hp} {{< fa arrow-right >}} [(Negative)]{.hi-red}

    - Population (workers) grow at a [rate $n \geq 0$]{.hi} (usually very small) 

    - As there are more people, there is [less]{.hp} [capital per worker]{.hi} determined by [$nk$]{.hi}

::: {.faded}
- $\delta k$: Capital depreciation

:::

- [$\delta k$: Capital depreciation]{.hp} {{< fa arrow-right >}} [(Negative)]{.hi-red}

    - Capital requires service (repairs) {{< fa arrow-right >}} We lose $\delta k$ every period
    - $0 < \delta < 1$

## Solow Growth Model - Steady State

The [Solow Model]{.h} allows us to consider a [steady state]{.hi} level of capital

::: {.fragment}
- [Steady State:]{.hi} When the economy has fully adjusted and there is no change in some variable
    - The economy is in an [equilibrium]{.hi} that is [stable]{.hi}
    - [Output]{.hi} and [capital per worker]{.hi} are no longer changing
:::

::: {.fragment}
We want $k$ to be in [steady state]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- This means that $\Delta k = 0$ {{< fa arrow-right >}} Because $k$ is no longer changing

- We call this level of [capital]{.hi} $k^{*}$
:::

---

## Solow Growth Model - Steady State

When the economy is in [steady state $k^{*}$]{.hi} we have:

::: {.fragment}
$$
    \Delta k = 0 = sf(k^{*}) - (n + \delta)k^{*} \\
    sf(k^{*}) = (n + \delta)k^{*}
$$

More than the math, I want you to understand this intuitively

- Graphs are great to be able to talk about this

## Solow Growth Model Dynamics

Be aware of all the possible moving pieces in this model

It allows us to [explore the effects of changes in]{.hi}:

::: {.vertical-center}
- [$s$:]{.hp} Savings Rates
- [$\delta$:]{.hp} Depreciation Rate
- [$n$:]{.hp} Population Growth Rate

## Solow Growth Model

[What? Why? Huh?]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- [Why]{.hp} this model?

    - It is a simple and intuitive way of understanding how [savings, population growth,]{.hp} and technology change impacts [long-run economic growth]{.hi}
:::

::: {.fragment}
- [What]{.hp} does it do? {{< fa arrow-right >}} Decomposes growth into [two key forces]{.hi}

[_1._]{.hp} [Capital accumulation]{.h} through savings and investment

[_2._]{.hp} [Population growth]{.h} as the labor force expands
:::

::: {.fragment}
- [Huh?]{.hp} [Again with this fantasy stuff?]{.hi}

## Criticisms of Solow

::: {.vertical-center}
- There is a constant savings rate that is [exogenously given]{.hi}

- Ignores [human capital]{.hi} 

- Predicts too much convergence

    - Economies with the same rates $(s,n,\delta)$ [should]{.hi} reach the same [output per person]{.hi}

- No role for institutions or policy

- Treats [labor]{.hi} as [homogeneous]{.hi} where all workers are the same
