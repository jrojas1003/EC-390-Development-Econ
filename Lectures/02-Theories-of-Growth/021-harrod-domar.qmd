[Savings drive growth]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.vertical-center}

::: {.incremental}
- The [more a country saves]{.hp}, the more it can [invest in capital]{.hp}

- To produce output, the only thing we need is [capital]{.hi}

    - We ignore labor

## Harrod-Domar Growth Model

::: {.align-center}
We are after the [Growth Rate of Income (or production)]{.hi}
:::

$$
    \dfrac{\Delta Y}{Y}
$$

::: {.incremental}
- There are only [4 equations]{.hp}
- [Algebra]{.hi} is easy once you know how and where you are going
:::

## Harrod-Domar Growth Model

[Our 4 equations]{.hi .align-center}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .align-center}
[_1._]{.note .hp} $S = sY$

[_2._]{.note .hp} $S = I$
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .align-center}
[_3._]{.note .hp} $I = \Delta K$

[_4._]{.note .hp} $\Delta K = c \Delta Y$

[$sY = S \Rightarrow$]{.fragment} [$sY = I \Rightarrow$]{.fragment} [$sY = \Delta K \Rightarrow$]{.fragment} [$sY = c \Delta Y$]{.fragment .hp} 
:::

## Harrod-Domar: Growth Rate of Output

Recall we want to find the [Growth Rate of Income]{.hi} $\dfrac{\Delta Y}{Y}$

::: {.fragment}
We can rearrange $sY = c \Delta Y$ to get it
:::

::: {.fragment}
$$
    \dfrac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \dfrac{s}{c}
$$
:::

::: {.incremental}
- This states that the [Rate of Growth of GDP]{.hi} is determined by the [net national savings ratio $(s)$]{.hp} and the [national capital-output ratio $(c)$]{.hp}, at the same time

    - [Positively]{.hi-green} related to the savings ratio
    - [Negatively]{.hi-red} related to the economy's capital-output ratio
:::

---

## Harrod-Domar: Growth Rate of Output

$$
    \dfrac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \dfrac{s}{c}
$$

Let's break it down a bit

::: {.fragment .align-center}
$\dfrac{1}{c}$ measures the [efficiency of capital use]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- The lower the value of $c$ (the more efficient) that an economy runs at, the greater the output that can be gained from additional investment
    - A higher $c$ means less output of $Y$
    - If $c$ increases, then the [growth rate decreases]{.hi}
:::

---

## Harrod-Domar: Growth Rate of Output

$$
    \dfrac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \dfrac{s}{c}
$$

::: {.fragment .align-center}
$s$ is the economy's [saving rate]{.hi}, which influences the level of investment
:::

::: {.incremental}
- A higher $s$ implies a higher investment level
- If $s$ increases, then the [growth rate increases]{.hi}
:::

## Harrod-Domar Lessons

In other words, the [Rate of Growth]{.hi} depends as much on the [efficiency of capital investments]{.hi-green} as the [amount of capital invested]{.hi-teal}

<br><br>

::: {.fragment}
In its simplest form, a country that wants to [speed up development]{.h}:

[_1._]{.note .hp} [Save more]{.hi}

[_2._]{.note .hp}  Build more [efficient capital]{.hi}

## Harrod-Domar Simple Example

- In 2011, Indonesia had a [capital-output]{.hi} ratio of 4

$$
    \dfrac{K}{Y} = c = 4
$$

If we want a [growth rate of 6%]{.hp}, [Harrod-Domar]{.hi} tells us that Indonesia needs a [savings rate]{.hi} of?

<br>

[$\dfrac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \dfrac{s}{c}$]{.fragment} [$\Rightarrow 6 = \dfrac{s}{4}$]{.fragment} [$\Rightarrow 24 = s$]{.fragment .hp}

## Harrod-Domar Growth Model

With theoretical models, you should always ask yourself: 

[What? Why? Huh?]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.incremental .small}
- [Why]{.hp} this model? 
    - After World War II, much of Europe was destroyed
    - There was a lack of [capital $(K)$]{.hi}
    - The [Marshall Plan]{.hi} was a large [foreign aid package]{.hi} from the US to Western Europe
    - The aid package greatly sped up recovery of Europe and boosted economic growth
- [What]{.hp} does it do?
    - Explains how savings, capital, and output are potentially linked together
- [Huh?]{.hp} [That's not realistic]{.hi}
:::

## Criticisms of Harrod-Domar

[No model is perfect]{.hi .align-center}

[But good models help explain a small part of life]{.hi .align-center}

[But these are not without proper criticism:]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- Overly simplified
- No [population growth]{.hi}
- No [technology change]{.hi}
- The $K = cY$ assumption is concerning
    - Assumes that turning capital into output is easy
    - Assumes [constant returns to capital]{.hi}
- Policy enacted based on the model did not increase economic growth significantly
