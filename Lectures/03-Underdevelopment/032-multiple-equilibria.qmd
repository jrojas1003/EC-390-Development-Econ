## How Can There Be More Than One?

Basically, reflects a more (but not entirely) realistic possibility of outcomes

We will be matching [expectations]{.hi} to [reality]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Recall that [expectations]{.hi} are not necessarily reality but they do inform it 

- [Multiple Equilibria]{.hp} is the condition where [more than one equilibria exists]{.hi}

- These equilibria may sometimes be [ranked]{.hi}, in the sense that one is preferred to another

- The standard diagram takes an S-shape around a 45 degree line

## Multiple Equilibria 

Components of the [S-Diagram]{.hi}

::: {.vertical-center}

[Wavy Line]{.hi} {{< fa arrow-right >}} [Private Decision Function]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- Tells us the best decision an individual can make [given decisions of all other agents]{.hi}
:::

[45 Degree Line]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- Shows all points where an [individual's decision is exactly the same as the expected decision]{.hi} of all other agents

[Finding the Equilibria]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- We identify where the [private decision function]{.hi} is the same as the [45 degree line]{.hi}
    - These points are where it is privately optimal to do what other agents are doing
    - No agent has an incentive to deviate
- But there is [stability]{.hp} to consider as well
