## HRV Growth

Hausmann-Rodrik-Velasco (HRV) attempt to identify the greatest hindrance to growth for each developing nation

::: {.incremental}
- Broadly speaking, low growth is caused by low return on investment or a high-cost of borrowing
    - Low returns on investment are the result of poor productive capability or low returns due to institutional failure
- HRV propose a decision tree framework to focus on a country's most binding constraints on economic growth
- By targeting the [most binding constraint]{.hi} produces advangates over other approaches to policy selection

## HRV - Four Principles of Differntial Diagnosis

::: {.vertical-center}
[_1._]{.hp} The [Shadow Price]{.hi} of the Constraint is High

[_2._]{.hp} Movements in the constraint produce significant movement in the objective

[_3._]{.hp} People attempt to overcome or bypass the constraint

[_4._]{.hp} Agents less intensive in a [binding constraint]{.hi} are more likely to thrive
