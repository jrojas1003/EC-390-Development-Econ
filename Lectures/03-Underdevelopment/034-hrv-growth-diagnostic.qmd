## HRV Growth

Hausmann-Rodrik-Velasco (HRV) attempt to identify the greatest hindrance to growth for each developing nation

::: {.incremental}
- Broadly speaking, low growth is caused by low return on investment or a high-cost of borrowing
    - Low returns on investment are the result of poor productive capability or low returns due to institutional failure
- HRV propose a decision tree framework to focus on a country's most binding constraints on economic growth
- By targeting the [most binding constraint]{.hi} produces advangates over other approaches to policy selection

## HRV - Four Principles of Differntial Diagnosis

::: {.vertical-center}
[_1._]{.hp} The [Shadow Price]{.hi} of the Constraint is High

[_2._]{.hp} Movements in the constraint produce significant movement in the objective

[_3._]{.hp} People attempt to overcome or bypass the constraint

[_4._]{.hp} Agents less intensive in a [binding constraint]{.hi} are more likely to thrive

## HRV - Four Principles

[_1._]{.hp} The [Shadow Price]{.hi} of the Constraint is High

::: {.align-center .small}
> A [Binding Constraint]{.hp} on growth is one where [relaxing it would yield large benefits]{.hp}. 
Meaning its [shadow price]{.h} (the implicit value of easing the constraint) is [high]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental .small}
- If something is [scarce because of low supply rather than low demand]{.hi}, it is likely a [true contraint]{.hp}
    - Ex: If credit is limited and interest rates are high, even though many agents want to borrow, [financial access is binding]{.hp}
    - If little borrowing occurs because agents do not see high returns, then [fincance is not a binding issue]{.hi}
- Clues come from high observed returns, rationing, congestion, or other indicators that an input is in short supply
:::

::: {.notes}
[If we could ease this bottleneck, would growth respond strongly?]{.hi}

If yes, then it is probably a key constraint

## HRV - Four Principles

[_2._]{.hp} Movements in the constraint produce significant movement in the objective

::: {.align-center .small}
> If something is truly binding, then [changes in it should move the economy's main outcomes]{.hp}. 
:::

::: {.incremental .small}
- If we suspect that [limited access to credit constrains investment]{.hi}, then lowering real interest rates or improving access to loans [should incrase investment]{.hi}
- The relationship should be clear and consistent
    - When the [constraints bites harder, outcomes worsen]{.hi-red}
    - When it [eases,outcomes should improve]{.hi-green}
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
This principle checks the sensitivity of the constraint. 
:::

::: {.notes}
If chaniging the variable does not affect performance much, it is probably not the real bottleneck

## HRV - Four Principles

[_3._]{.hp} People attempt to overcome or bypass the constraint

::: {.align-center .small}
> Economic actors do not passively accept constraints, [they adapt or find workarounds]{.hp}. 
:::

::: {.incremental}
- When things fail, agents might invest or find in alternatives
    - The power grid fails often, so agents invest in generators to overcome unreliable electricity
    - If crime is high, agents might invest in private security
    - If taxes are too much or unreasonable, business might shift toward cash only 
- By observing [coping mechanisms]{.hi}, we can better identify what the economy's main problems are
:::

::: {.notes}
If agents spend a lot of effort or resources getting around certiain limitations, that limitation is likely binding

## HRV - Four Principles

[_4._]{.hp} Agents less intensive in a [binding constraint]{.hi} are more likely to thrive

::: {.align-center .small}
> If a constraint is binding, [agents that participate less or are less exposed to it will perform better]{.hp}. 
:::

::: {.incremental}
- If a contraint does not directly (or it is less prevalent) affect your action, then the agent is not as limited 
    - Ex: If infrastructure is the issue, exporting firms near a port may grow faster than inland producers
    - Ex: If political corruption is the main concern, then agents that are politically connected will succeed while others stagnate
:::

::: {.align-center .fragment}
This principle checks the [variation within the economy]{.hi}, which [agents grow and which do not?]{.hi}
:::

::: {.notes}
The presence (or absence) of thriving sectors reveals a lot about what is holding back the rest of the economy. 

Why are the successes succeeding, and the failures failing.
