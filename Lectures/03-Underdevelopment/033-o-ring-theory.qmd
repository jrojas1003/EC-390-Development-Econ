## Introduction

This model leans in on [complementarities in production]{.hi} in a strong way

::: {.fragment}
- The notion is that modern production (comparative to tradiotional crafts production) requires [many activities be done well together]{.hi} in order for any of them to amount to a high value 
:::

::: {.fragment}
The name comes from the unfortunate 1986 [Challenger disaster]{.hi} where one small and inexpensive part (the O-Ring) failed and caused the space shuttle to explode

## Key Feature - Complementarities Among Inputs

Start by thinking of the model as describing what goes on inside a firm, but we can extend this to an industry or sector of the economy

::: {.incremental}
- Suppose that production is broken down into $n$ tasks
- For simplicity, we say that these tasks are ordered by the required level of skill to complete them, $q$, where $0 \leq q \leq 1$
    - The higher the skill, the higher the probability of it being ["successfully completed"]{.hi}
- The production function is a simple one:
    - Output is given by multiplying the $q$ values of each $n$ tasks togehter, and this is then multiplied by a term $B$ that is just a production scalar

## O-Ring Production

$$
    BF(q_{i},q_{j}) = q_{i}q_{j}
$$

::: {.fragment}
Let's make a simplifying assumption that $B = 1$ so then we just have $$F(q_{i},q_{j}) = q_{i}q_{j}$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
Now let's introduce other assumptions

::: {.incremental}
- Firms are risk-neutral
- Labor markets are competitive
- Workers supply labor inelastically

risk neutral: Firms behae as if it maximizes expected profit ignoring variance or uncertainty
