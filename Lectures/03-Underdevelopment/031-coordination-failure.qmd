## Important Terms

[Complementarity:]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- An action taken by an agent, that increases the incentives for other agents to take similar actions
:::

[Coordination Failure]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- A situation where the [inability]{.h} of agents to coordinate their [behavior]{.h} leads to an [outcome]{.h} that leaves everyone worse off than in an alternative situation that is also an [equilibrium]{.h}
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[Coordination Failure]{.hi} is essentially where agents do not work optimally together to reach the [best possible]{.hi} outcome
:::

## Expectations

Let's quickly introduce the important economic concept of [Expectations]{.hp}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- [Agents]{.h} hold [beliefs]{.hp} of what [they think will happen]{.hi}

    - You [expect]{.hi} that studying hard will improve your grades
    - You [expect]{.hi} the empty restaurant will not be good

- These [beliefs]{.hp} then [shape your behavior]{.hi}

    - You [study more]{.hi}
    - You [go eat somewhere else]{.hi}
:::

## Complementarities

[Expectations]{.hi} are an important component of [complementarities]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
> [Complementarities]{.hi} will often involve investments where returns depend on [other investments being made]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- An important example is the presence of firms using special skills by agents and those agents acquiring those skills

- Later we will see a model that directly deals with worker skills complementing each other in production
:::

::: {.notes}
Firms will not enter a market or locate somewhere if workers do not possess the skills the firms need, but workers will not acquire those skills if there are no firms to employ them
:::

## Coordination Between Agents

[Coordination]{.hi} gets more difficult/unlikely as the number of agents increases

There can also be added [limitations to coordinating behavior]{.hi}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- Agents may [not be able to coordinate at all]{.hi} [{{< fa arrow-right >}} Where-to-Meet Dilemma]{.h .fragment .small}

- Even if agents can coordinate, it may be difficult to convince them to

## Price of Fish Example

[Reading on Site]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- Central Issue: Fishermen in India were not sure what the local prices were
    - A good catch might not fetch a lot of money if a fisher man chooses a [saturated market]{.hi}
    - This led to surpluses and shortages
    - [Coordination Failure]{.hp}

## Price of Fish Example

> [Central Issue: Fishermen in India were not sure what the local prices were]{.small}

::: {.incremental}
- The most basic supply and demand curves [require full information for all agents]{.hi}
- Without information, volatility and uncertainty enter the market
- The fishermen have no information on the local prices, and they were not sure where to sell
- This leads to volatile prices in the market
- With cell phones, information became accesible 
- Cell phones also allowed them to [coordinate]{.hp}
- ["Law of One Price"]{.hi} emerged
:::

## Price of Fish Example

> [How did cellphones allow agents to overcome the coordination failure?]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- They allowed fishermen to [communicate with buyers and other sellers]{.hi}
- They could call a number of markets and find out where the price was highest
- Generally aware of where buyers had high [Willingness to Pay]{.hi}
- Sellers were able to spread out across the different markets in an optimal way
- Eliminated inefficiencies like guessing

::: {.notes}
Cellphones made markets more efficient

Everyone benefited: Profits rose by 8% and prices fell by 4%

There was economic growth stemming from coordination
