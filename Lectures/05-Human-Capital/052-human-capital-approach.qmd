## Human Capital

[Definition:]{.h} Catch-all term we use in economics to refer to education, health, skills, and other human capacities that can raise productivity 

::: {.fragment}
Human capital can be acquired [through investment]{.hi .fragment}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Education
- Health care
- Training, therapy, etc.

- They affect [productivity, income, happiness, and lifespan]{.hi}

- We may not directly talk about education or health, but rather the [human capital]{.hi} it creates
:::

---

## Complementarities

[Health and Education]{.hi} investments have large [complementarities]{.h}

::: {.incremental}
- If children are [malnourished or have high mortality]{.hp}, [education investment]{.hi} will not be as effective
    - Poor health in children leads to:
        - Low school attendance
        - Less attention in class
        - Lower lifetime earnings and returns to investment
- To effectively [increase human capital]{.hi}, we need [investments in both health and education]{.hi} simultaneously
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Unfortunately, invetsments take considerable time to pay off]{.hi .align-center}

## Invest Now, Returns Later

## Invest Now, Returns Later

Investing in education means that we [expect higher earnings in the future]{.hi} than we would have obtained otherwise

::: {.fragment}
- These [future income gains]{.hi} must be compared with the [total costs incurred]{.hp} to understand it as an investment
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Education costs include direct costs:
    - tuition costs
    - books and uniforms
- And indirect costs:
    - [foregone income]{.hp}
:::

## Let's Model It

Formally, we can write the [Discounted Value of Education]{.hi} where [$E$ is income with extra education]{.hi-green}, [$N$ is income without extra education]{.hi-red}, $t$ is year, $i$ is the [discount rate]{.hi} and this is summed over expected years of working life:

$$
    \text{DVE} = \dfrac{E_{t} - N_{t}}{(1 + i)^{{t}}}
$$

::: {.fragment}
We do this because these decisions are not equivalent across individuals

- People with [higher discount rates]{.hi} will be [less likely to invest in education]{.hi}

    [They value the increase in the future income less than current income]{.hp .fragment .align-center}
:::

---

## Discounted Value Example

Let's find out if being here is worth it 

::: {.incremental}
- Suppose that your earnings with a degree will be 100 [$(E = 100)$]{.fragment .h}
- Without a degree, your earnings will be 20 [$(N = 20)$]{.fragment .h}
- Suppose your discount rate is 20%, you value the future 20% less than the present [$(i = 0.2)$]{.fragment .h}
- Lastly, suppose you will earn your degree in 4 years [$(t = 4)$]{.h .fragment}
:::

::: {.fragment}
We put it all together in the $DVE$ equation:
:::

::: {.align-center}
[$DVE = \dfrac{E_{t} - N_{t}}{(1 + i)^{{t}}}$]{.fragment}  [$= \dfrac{100 - 20}{(1.2)^{4}}$]{.fragment} [$= 38.6$]{.fragment}
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[The additional 80 dollars "future you"]{.hi-red} would earn with extra education is only worth [38.6 to "present you"]{.hi-green}
:::

---

## Discounted Value Example (v2)

We can adapt this equality to model other things as well [, we just need a start and end value]{.hi .fragment}

[And we can solve for any of the components if we have the other information]{.hi .align-center .fragment}

::: {.fragment}
Let us find the discount rate such that we are [indifferent]{.h} the future value of 2 extra dollars in 5 years from now 

$$
    DVEM = \dfrac{2}{(1 + i)^{5}} = 1
$$ 
:::

---

## Discounted Value Example (v2)

$$
    DVEM = \dfrac{2}{(1 + i)^{5}} = 1
$$ 

::: {.fragment} 
\begin{align*}
    2 &= (1 + i)^{5} \\ 
    \sqrt[5]{2} &= 1 + i \\
    \sqrt[5]{2} - 1 &= i \\
    i &\approx 0.149
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.fragment}
[To be indifferent between 2 dollars in 5 years and 1 dollar today, we would need to have a discount rate of]{.hi .align-center}

$$
    \sim 14.9\%
$$

## Discounted Value of Education

[Why do we care about discount rates when thinking about economic development?]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Why might someone with a lower income have a higher discount rate?
    - If you are very worried about your current situation, the value you place on something in the distant future is very small
- Consider a subsistence farmer:
    - Do they send their children to school, which will pay off later in their lives (and allow them to take care of their parents)?
    - Or do they keep them at home to help farm the land, which will pay off tomorrow?
- Clearly, income and discount rates are [negatively correlated]{.hp}
:::

## Investing in Education

Hopefully you can see why [saving and investing]{.hi} is a difficult decision to make

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- There might be more pressing matters that require resources
- Solely based on expected return value, it [might not be worth it]{.hp}
- If we do [invest]{.h}, what's truly to say things will pay-off as we expect?
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
But thankfully, when possible, progress has been made

## Social Versus Private Benefits and Costs

[Education plays a key role in the ability of a developing country to absorb modern tech and develop the capacity for self-sustaining growth and development]{.hi .align-center}

[And like much of everything else, there are cost, benefits, and spillovers to consider]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- We try to alter the [incentives]{.hi} of individuals to get them to pursue more education
- However, the [optimal education decision]{.hi} for an individual does not necessarily correspond to the [socially optimal level of education]{.h}
:::

---

## Social Versus Private Benefits and Costs

[Private (individual)]{.hi} returns grow faster than [social returns]{.h}

::: {.fragment}
- Individuals benefit from education by earning more money and gaining higher quality skills
- Society only benefits from part of the individual's increased income and education
:::

::: {.fragment}

[Social costs]{.hi} grow more quickly than private costs

::: {.incremental}
- [Higher cost of capital]{.hp} and recurrent costs of higher education (post-primary) is very costly
- Subsidization of higher education reduces costs for individuals and increases costs for society
:::

:::

---

## Private and Social Benefits

![](images/social-private-edu.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Private and Social Benefits

- Optimal education choice happens when:

[slope of returns and slope of costs are the same]{.hi .align-center}

[marginal benefit = marginal cost]{.hi .align-center .fragment}

::: {.fragment}
Given our setup, this means that the [socially optimal level of education]{.h} is less than [individually optimal level of education]{.hi}

- This is why the Millenium Development Goal focuses on [Primary Education]{.hi}, not university education
:::

---

## Education Has Increased

- In 1990, halve of the world's countries had achieved universal primary education, up from 28% in 1960

- Median primary enrollment increased from 80% to 99% in 1990

- Median secondary enrollment rates have increased from 13% in 1960 to 45% in 1990

- In 1960, 29 countries had no college students and by 1990 only 3 had no college students

---

## Has Education Failed?

Despite these advances in availability of education, the growth effects have been dissapointing

::: {.fragment}
- At the very least, they have been less than expected
- Studies have concluded that although education is important, there is a weak association with growth
:::

## What's the lesson here?

::: {.fragment}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- [We are good at controlling specific outcomes]{.hi}
    - We know how to increase test scores
    - We know how to increase enrollment rates
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.incremental}
- [But we are not very good at generating growth through education]{.hi}
    - It could be that educaton has strong complementarities with other institutions/services 
        - Health, Safety, Environment, etc.
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
But [maybe we shouldn't only worry about growth]{.hi}, education improves well-being nonetheless
