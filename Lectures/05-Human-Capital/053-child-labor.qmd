## The Children DO NOT Yearn for the Mines 

This is an [unfortunately]{.hi} widespread problem in developing countries

When children under the [age of 15 work]{.h}:

::: {.incremental}
- Time working disrupts time in school [and in some cases prevents them from going altogether]{.hi .fragment}
- The health of child workers are significantly worse
    - This can cause [physical stunting]{.hi} which is very common
- They are subject to cruel and exploitative working conditions

## Child Labor

[Definition: Either under the minimum age for work (usually 15 years old) or up to 17 years of age, and engaged in work that poses a threat to their health, safety, or morals, or are subject to conditions of forced labor]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
According to the [International Labor Organization (ILO)]{.hi}, as of 2015 there are:

- [152 million]{.hp} children classified as ["child laborers"]{.hp}
- 48% are reportedly just 11 years or younger
- 73 million were found to be doing some hazardous work that directly endangers their [health, saftey, and moral development]{.hi}

## Child Labor

[Geographical concentration]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- Africa and the Asia and Pacific region account for about 90% of all child labor
- 71% work in agriculture, 12% in industry, 17% in services

[Working Conditions]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental .small}
- More than 50% of child laborers work in some form of child labor endanger their health or well-being:
    - Hazard materials
    - Sexual exploitation
    - Trafficking
    - Debt bondage
- Every year, about 22,000 children die as a result of work-related accidents

## Child Work vs Leisure Time

In some cases, work time comes from the child's [leisure time]{.hi} instead of school time

- Recall not many child workers attend school

::: {.incremental}
- Even if they do go to school, child labor will:
    - Reduce time for homework
    - Cause the child to be tired at school, resulting in losing the benefit of being in school being less
    - Likely cause them to drop out sooner than otherwise

## Ban on Child Labor

It is not obvious that an [immediate ban]{.hi} would be in the best interest for the child

::: {.fragment}
- Without the ability to work, a child may lose valuable income, which may cause them to be severely malnourished
    - With work (wages), school fees may become accessible
    - Basic nutrition is more likely
    - Health care may become available to them
:::

::: {.fragment}
But there is a set of circumstances under which both the child and the family [benefit unambiguously]{.hi} from a ban:

## Ban on Child Labor - Multiple Equilibria

Let's model child labor

We first make two assumptions:

::: {.fragment}
[_1._]{.hp} A household with a sufficiently high icnome [would not]{.hi} send its children to work

- As expected, there is strong evidence that this is true
:::

::: {.fragment}
[_2._]{.hp} A child's and adult labor are [substitutes]{.hi}

- In reality, children are not as productive as adults and adults can do any work that children can do
:::

::: {.fragment}
- A frequent rationalisation for child labor often said is that children have special productive abilities, such as small fingers [Video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yTcpE4uP7Mw){target=_blank .hi}
:::

::: {.notes}
As a result of this substitution of labor observation, we can consider the supply of adult and child labor together
