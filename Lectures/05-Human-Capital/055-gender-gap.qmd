## Education

Young females receive less education than young males in most low-income countries

::: {.fragment}
- Large majorities of illiterate people and those unable to attend school are female
- This [educational gender gap]{.hi} is greater in the least-developed countries in Africa and in South Asia
    - [Definition:]{.hi} Male-female differences in school access and completion
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
- In higher-income countries, there is a trend of a significantly higher and growing share of female than male enrollment in university education
- This has begun extending to many upper-middle-income countries across the world

It also reinforces [social inequality]{.hi}

## Expanding Educational Opportunities for Women

Logically, increasing educational access to women is economically desirable. A non-exhaustive list of reasons:

[_1._]{.hp .note} [Rate of return on women's education is higher than men's in most developing nations]{.hi}

[_2._]{.hp .note} [Increasing women's education has significant externalitites]{.hi}

[_3._]{.hp .note} [Significant aid toward breaking out of vicious circles of poverty]{.hi}

## Expanding Educational Opportunities for Women

Logically, increasing educational access to women is economically desirable. A non-exhaustive list of reasons:

[_1._]{.hp .note} [Rate of return on women's education is higher than men's in most developing nations]{.hi}

- Given that few women are enrolled in educational institutions, the next (marginal) girl to enroll is likely to be more talented (on average) than the marginal boy

[_2._]{.hp .note} [Increasing women's education has significant externalitites]{.hi}

- Increases in education leads to more than just increases in productivity
- It also leads to greater labor force participation, later marriage, lower fertility, greatly improved child health and nutrition
- All of this benefits [the next generation too]{.hi}

[_3._]{.hp .note} [Significant aid toward breaking out of vicious circles of poverty]{.hi}

- Women carry a disproportionate burden of poverty, we can think of education as a [binding constraint]{.hp}
- If we can ease access to education, we can expect to see greater development

## Health and Gender

Healthcare, generally worldwide, is [male-centered]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Medical research and treatment standars often based on [male physiology]{.hi} {{< fa arrow-right >}} misdiagnosis for women
- [Health funding]{.hi} favors male-dominant conditions and women's health is reduced to [reproduction]{.hi}
- Limited access and agency, like cultural/societal norms, restrict women's mobility and decision-making
- There are [data gaps]{.hi} as there is little sex-disaggregated health data which masks disparities

## "Missing Women" Mystery

There is a general bias toward boys in most cultures, which creates this phenomenon

::: {.fragment}
- The number of women [is far lower than what would be expected]{.hp} given natural birth and survival rates
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Amartya Sen (1990)]{.hi} coined the term and estimated that tens of millions of women are ["missing"]{.hi} due to excess female mortality

## "Missing Women" Mystery

::: {.incremental}
- [Natural Ratio:]{.hp} Normally, there are slightly more women than men in a population because women tend to live longer
- [Observed Pattern:]{.hp} In countries like India and China, the ratio is skewed toward men
- [Main Causes:]{.hp} 
    - [Sex-selective abortion]{.hi}
    - [Girl's health neglect]{.hi}
    - [Discrimination in access to healthcare]{.hi}
- [Economic Implications:]{.hp} Fewer women can [distort labor markets]{.hi .fragment} [,marriage markets]{.hi .fragment} [,long-term demographics]{.hi .fragment}
:::

::: {.notes}
Labor markets: Fewer women mean smaller female labor force, reducing overall productivity and slowing economic growth. Can also distort wage gaps

Marriage markets: (assuming heteronormative) With men greatly outnumbering women, it creates "marriage squeezes" where many men cannot find partners, increasing social tensions, trafficking, and forced marriages

Long-term Demos: Persistent gender imbalance can lead to aging populations and reduced fertility rates, destabilizing population growth and dependency ratios over time
