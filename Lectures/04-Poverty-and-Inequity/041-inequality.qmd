## What is Poverty and Inequality

We have previously talked about [Absolute Poverty]{.hi} previously

We can define it again as:

- Not being able to meet basic daily needs for food, shelter, clothing, etc.

::: {.fragment .align-center}
Aside from [poverty]{.h}, we are interested in how [income is distributed]{.hi} across individuals
:::

---

## Income Inequality

When thinking of comparing nations, we have measured incomes on national averages which has its own flaws

[But how do we measure how income is distributed across individuals?]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
[Income Inequality]{.h} happens when income is unequal across households

- This creates an income distribution which we can later see where [wealth is concentrated]{.hi}
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Perfect wealth equality]{.hi-green} would be where everyone has an equal share of wealth
:::

---

## Income Inequality

[Is income inequality necessarily bad?]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- It depends
- Think of the theoretical outcomes that produce inequalities in societies
    - Economists believe that some level of inequality will naturally exist
    - Different skills will affect how productive someone may be
    - In the most strict sense of economics, individual productions affect how much someone is paid
    - Some inequality may be beneficial, [it incetivizes individuals to increase their productivity/skill]{.hi-green}
    - However, if [inequality]{.h} interferes with individual's ability to perform basic functions, [then we have a problem]{.hp}

[There are 4 criteria to consider]{.hi .fragment}

## Income Inequality Visualized

Let there be an economy with [10 people]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Incomes are: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 
- Average Income: 10
- What percent of total income does the [first person hold?]{.hi}
    - $10\%$
- What percent of total income do the [first 5 people hold?]{.hi}
    - $50\%$
:::

---

## Perfect Income Equality

![](images/perfect-equality.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Income Inequality Visualized

Let's change it up. There are still 10 people in the economy

::: {.incremental}
- Incomes are: 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 25
- Average Income: 10
- What percent of total income does the [first person hold?]{.hi}
    - $5/100 \Rightarrow 5\%$
- What percent of total income do the [first 5 people hold?]{.hi}
    - $\dfrac{5 + 5 + 5 + 10 + 10}{100} \Rightarrow 35\%$
- What percent of total income does the [wealthiest person hold?]{.hi}
    - $25\%$

## Lorenz Curves

[Lorenz Curves]{.hi} are functions that show [what percentage of wealth the bottom x% control]{.hi}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- [Perfect equality]{.h} is represented by a [45 degree line]{.h}
    - The Bottom 10% have 10% of the wealth
    - The Bottom 20% have 20% of the wealth
    - And so on
    - Everyone has the same amount of wealth
:::

---

## Lorenz Curves - Perfect Equality

![](images/lorenz-equality.jpg){fig-align="center"}

---

## Lorenz Curves

On the other extreme, consider [perfect inequality]{.hp}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- The Bottom 10% have 0% of the wealth
- The Bottom 20% have 0% of the wealth
- And so on
- Until we get to [the last person, who has all of the nation's wealth]{.hp}
:::

## Lorenz Curves - Perfect Inequality

![](images/lorenz-inequality.jpg){fig-align="center"}

---

## Lorenz Curves

::: {.vertical-center}
In reality, [countries fall somewhere between the two extremes]{.hi}

- The extent of inequality can be (somewhat) represented by the area between the [Lorenz Curve]{.hi} and the [45 degree line]{.hi}
:::

## Lorenz Curve - Realistic Example

## Gini Coefficient

Graphs are a good visual representation of the wealth distribution 

- [Quantifying]{.h} this would be very useful

The [Gini Coefficient]{.hi} measures how far away a country is from perfect equality

::: {.fragment}
We define it as:

$$ 
    \text{GINI} = \dfrac{A}{A + B}
$$

:::

::: {.incremental}
- The [Gini Coefficient]{.hi} can range from 0 to 1
    - A [coefficient of 0]{.hi-green} indicates [perfect equality]{.hi-green}
    - A [coefficient of 1]{.hi-red} indicates [perfect inequality]{.hi-red}
:::

## Gini Coefficient 

It is a good metric, but does not provide all information about the distribution of wealth

Take for example these two diffferent countries:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/lorenz-failure-a.jpg){fig-align="center" height="400"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/lorenz-failure-b.jpg){fig-align="center" height="400"}
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Gini is approximately the same for both graphs

However income inequality affects two different segments of the population

First graph: Income inquality is prevalent for low income individuals

Second graph: middle income is carved out

## Measuring Absolute Poverty

It is difficult to measure the (exact) Gini Coefficient [{{< fa arrow-right >}} we need to know incomes for everyone in a country]{.hi}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- The data, isn't usually available for developing countries, so we need to use some coarser measure
- How can we get a [good idea of the intensity of poverty in a particular region?]{.hi}
    - We can use the [Headcount Ratio Index]{.h}, which is the percentage of people living below the poverty line
:::

---

## Headcount Ratio Index

Say that the [absolute poverty line is $2]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Country A has 3 Million out of 10 Million at or below this [poverty line]{.hi}
    - The [Headcount Ratio is $H = 3/10 = 30\%$]{.h}
- But the [Headcount Ratio Index]{.h} tells us nothing about how the poor are distrubted beneath the [poverty line]{.hi}
    - Everyone living at $1.50 per day is much different than everyone living at $0.10 per day
:::

---

## Total Poverty Gap

We can instead look at the [Total Poverty Gap (TPG)]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- This measures the total amount of money needed to get everyone up to the [absolute poverty line]{.hi}

$$
    TPG = \sum_{i=1}^{H} (Y_{p} - Y_{i})
$$

- Where $H$ is the total number of people below the poverty line
- $Y_{p}$ is the poverty line (eg. $2 per day)
- $Y_{i}$ is the income of the $i^{th}$ person under the poverty line
:::

---

## Other Measures of Poverty Gaps

We can also have the [Average Porvery Gap]{.hi}

$$
    APG = \dfrac{TPG}{\text{Country Population}}
$$

- This measures the amount [each person]{.hi} would need to be given to [everyone]{.hi} them out of poverty

::: {.fragment}
And [Average Income Shortfall]{.hi}

$$
    AIS = \dfrac{TPG}{\text{# of Poor}}
$$

- Measures the average amount [poor people]{.hi} are below the poverty line
:::

---

## Other Measures of Poverty Gaps

[Normalized Income Shortfall]{.hi}

$$
    NIS = \dfrac{AIS}{\text{Poverty Line}}
$$

- Measures the [Average Income Shortfall]{.h} as a [percentage of the poverty line]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
Let's look at some examples
:::

---

## Poverty Measure Examples

Let's return to our tiny country of [10 people]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- The [poverty line]{.hp} is $1,000 per year
- There are three people [living at or below the poverty line]{.h}
    - Person A makes $500
    - Person B makes $800
    - Person C makes $950
:::

::: {.fragment .tiny}

::: {.align-center}
Find all of [TPG, APG, AIS, NIS]{.hi}
:::

$$
    TPG = \sum_{i=1}^{H} (Y_{p} - Y_{i}) \;\; ; \;\; APG = \dfrac{TPG}{\text{Country Population}} \\ AIS = \dfrac{TPG}{\text{# of Poor}} \;\; ; \;\; NIS = \dfrac{AIS}{\text{Poverty Line}}
$$
:::

---

## Poverty Measure Examples {.small}

[Total Poverty Gap]{.hi}

::: {.fragment .small}
\begin{align*}
    TPG &= (100 - 500) + (1000 - 800) + (1000 - 950) \\ 
        &= 500 + 200 + 50 = 750
\end{align*}
:::

[Average Poverty Gap]{.hi}

::: {.fragment .small}
$$
    APG = \dfrac{TPG}{10} = \dfrac{750}{10} = 75
$$
:::

[Average Income Shortfall]{.hi}

::: {.fragment .small} 
$$
    AIS = \dfrac{TPG}{\text{# of Poor}} = \dfrac{750}{3} = 250
$$
:::

[Normalized Income Shortfall]{.hi}

::: {.fragment .small}
$$
    NIS = \dfrac{AIS}{\text{Poverty Line}} = \dfrac{250}{1000} = 25\%
$$
