## Microeconomic Theory of Fertility

Empirical evidence to support the idea that [economic conditions cause fertility rates to be high]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- Families have a [limited amount of resources]{.hp}, which can be used to support children or parents (a budget)
- The more children parents decide to have, the [less resources]{.hp} parents have for themselves
- Parents have a tradeoff to consider: [children provide benefits, but they also have a cost]{.hi .fragment}

## Microeconomic Theory of Fertility

Consider the following example

::: {.incremental}
- Suppose a household has an income of $30
- There are only two goods to consider:
    - [Food]{.hi-red} and [Children]{.hi-teal}
    - [Food]{.hi-red} is a [normal good]{.h} with price equal to $5
    - [Children]{.hi-teal} are an [inferior good]{.h} with price equal to $6
- The household has preferences over [food]{.hi-red} and [children]{.hi-teal}, which we represent with [indifference curves]{.hi}

## Finding the Budget Line

We know the household has a total of [$30]{.hi} to spend and they can spend it either on [Food]{.hi-red} or [Children]{.hi-teal}

::: {.incremental}
- If they buy only [Food]{.hi-red}, they can afford [6 units]{.hi-red} [{{< fa arrow-right >}} $\dfrac{30}{5} = 6$]{.h .fragment}
- If they "buy" only [Children]{.hi-teal}, they can afford [5 kids]{.hi-teal} [{{< fa arrow-right >}} $\dfrac{30}{6} = 5$]{.h .fragment}
- With these two points, we can draw the [budget line]{.hi}

## Higher Budget

Now let's say that the [households income increaes]{.hi} to $60

- The price of [both goods remains the same]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Now, if they buy only [Food]{.hi-red}, they can afford [12 units]{.hi-red} [{{< fa arrow-right >}} $\dfrac{60}{5} = 12$]{.h .fragment}
- And, if they "buy" only [Children]{.hi-teal}, they can afford [10 kids]{.hi-teal} [{{< fa arrow-right >}} $\dfrac{60}{6} = 10$]{.h .fragment}
- With these two points, we can draw the [new]{.hi} budget line

## Microeconomics of Fertility Decisions

- When income increased, the household [was better off buying more food and fewer children]{.hi}
- The household got wealthier, and kids are an inferior good 

---

## Children as an Inferior Good?

[This is generally what we observe]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- As income per capita increases, birth rates fall
- Parents face a trade-off:
    - There is a finite amount of resources
    - [Example]{.h} Income is limited
        - Do you [have a lot of children and invest very little in each?]{.hi}
        - Do you [have few kids and invest a lot in each?]{.hi}
- This is known as the ["Quality vs Quantity Trade-Off"]{.hp}
