## Demographic Transtion Stages

All contemporary developed nations have more or less passed through the same [four stages of modern population history]{.hi}

<br>

[_Stage 01._]{.hp .note} [High Birth Rates and High Death Rates]{.hi}

- Populations grow very slowly because [both birth rates and death rates are high]{.h} and roughly balance each other
- High mortality comes from poor sanitation, limited medical care, and frequent famines or epidemics

[_Stage 02._]{.hp .note} [High Birth Rates with Decline in Death Rates]{.hi} [(Transition)]{.h}

- Increased access to medicine, sanitation, and stronger food supply sources [reduce death rates sharply]{.h}
- Birth rates remain high for a while, [causing a population boom or “demographic explosion”]{.h}
