## To Drive the Point Home {.small}

There are 10 features that help us define key similarities and differences among developing countries

::: {.align-center}
> An important caveat to remind yourself of is that when we compare nations, we use [averages]{.hi} which inherently blur some important information

## Physical and Human Resource Endowment

::: {.vertical-center}
- Current developed countries had plentiful natural resources in early global development
- Current developing countries are typically lacking natural resources
    - If they do, resource extraction may be inefficient
    - Or other developed nations may take advantage 
- Skilled human resource endowment may be eve more stark
    - Think about where the "best" universities in the world are concentrated
:::

## Relative Size of GNI per Capita

::: {.vertical-center}
- Many people in developing countries are \textbf{subsisting}
    - Not everyone but a significant proportion
- Individuals that are in developed countries had more economic freedom in their earlier stages
- Developed countries got ahead economically in their early stages
    - They leveraged that accumulated wealth to extract resources
:::

## Climate Differences

::: {.vertical-center}
- Most developing countries are in a [tropical or sub-tropical climate]{.hi}
- Most developed contries have more [temperate climates]{.h}
- High head and humidity degrade soil and other natural goods
- There is also a higher prevalence of tropical diseases
    - The tropics are great for life to take hold at its most basic stages

## Population Size, Distribution, and Growth

::: {.vertical-center}
- Size
    - About 80% of world population (dominated by Asia and Africa) in [developing world]{.hi}
    - Smaller populations but often with [higher per capita resources]{.hi}
- Rapid population growth
    - Developing: High birth rates, and falling death rates {{< fa arrow-right >}} [rapid growth]{.hi}
    - Developed: Low birth rates and death rates {{< fa arrow-right >}} [slow or negative growth]{.hi}
- Distribution
    - Developing: Mostly [rural]{.h} but [urbanization rising fast]{.hi}
    - Developed: [Highly urbanized]{.hi} and densely networked cities
:::

## International Migration

::: {.vertical-center}
- Developed countries during development saw benefits from migration of labor
    - People migrate from low-income countries to higher-income countries seeking a higher quality of life
- Developing countries suffer from [Brain Drain]{.hi}
    - "Skilled" workers leave their home countries and work in developed countries
    - Individuals migrate for a better quality of life for themselves and their family
- [Brain Drain]{.hi} causes slow growth in developing countries as they lose valuable [human capital]{.hp}
:::

---

## International Trade

::: {.vertical-center}
- Developed countries benefited from free trade early on
    - [Free Trade]{.hi}: Goods are imported/exported without obstacles like quotas or tariffs
- Now we are going through a drastic shift in attitudes toward [Free Trade]{.hi}
    - Brexit
    - US Global Tariffs
:::

---

## Basic Scientific and Technology Research & Development Capabilities

::: {.vertical-center}
- Developed countries got ahead early with their scientific and technological research, primarly due to their ability to invest in them
- Developing countries are lagging far behind in R&D
    - Not necessarily their fault
:::

---

## Efficacy of Institutions

::: {.vertical-center}
- Many developed countries began with and still have strong institutions
    - Well defined property rights
    - Well defined rule of law
    - Strong judicial system
- Colonial powers established institutions that systemically created high inequality and extraction of resources to benefit foreign powers
- After countries obtain independence, self-governance is established but often through weak institutions and high possibility of corruption
:::

## Developed vs Developing Countries

::: {.vertical-center}
Unfortunately, developed countries are not always a good template of growth

Historically, nations that are ahead got there through a not-so-great reason

However, given globalization and stronger international market participation growth is normalizing in the world
