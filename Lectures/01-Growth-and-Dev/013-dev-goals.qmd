## 17 Sustainable Development Goals

In 2015, the UN adopted [17 Development Goals]{.hi} to be achieved by 2030.

There are three underlying principles that guides them:

- Universality principle {{< fa arrow-right >}} Apply to every nation
- Integration principle {{< fa arrow-right >}} There are interrelationships to consider between goals
- Transformation principle {{< fa arrow-right >}} Not sufficient to half-ass it

## Critique of Goals

They are not perfect by any measure.

One of my personal critiques is that it unfortunately relies on humans, but other than that we have:

::: {.fragment}
- Goals may not be prioritised 
- Too broad goals and difficult to address them all at once
- Trade-offs exist and some goals may be contradictory
    - Economic growth (Goal 8 and 9) may require environmental sacrifices (Goal 13 and 15)
- Lack of binding agreements
    - This is a general problem with everything the UN does
- Different access to resources across the globe
