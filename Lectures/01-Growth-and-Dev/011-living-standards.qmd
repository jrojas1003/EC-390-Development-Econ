## People Live Differently {.small}

[Who woulda thunk?]{.hi}

We can make some coarse comparisons across countries by some measures we will detail later

::: {.fragment}
- One of those is [Gross National Income]{.hi}
    - It is like GDP plus stuff:
        - It adds the money that the country's citizens and companies make [outside of the country]{.hi} 
        - It subtracts what foreigners make [inside the country and send out]{.hi}
:::

::: {.fragment}
Take for example the per capita GNI of different countries:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Japan {{< fa arrow-right >}} $36,030 
- Nigeria {{< fa arrow-right >}} $1,250
- France {{< fa arrow-right >}} $45,180
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- US {{< fa arrow-right >}} $83,660
- Brazil {{< fa arrow-right >}} $9,950
- Australia {{< fa arrow-right >}} $62,550

## People Live Differently

::: {.fragment}
We can think about living standards across the globe in four "stylised strata":
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Highest
- 2nd Highest
- 2nd Lowest
- Bottom
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[Let's dive in and see]{.hi} 
:::

## Bottom

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%" .small}
- Almost 700 million people (8.5% of the global population) live in extreme poverty
    - That is qualified as living on [less than $2.15 per day]{.hp}
- They will likely have serious concerns about their health, nutrition, education, sanitation, potable water, and housing
- They grow their own food and make their own shelter.
- They are essentially in a [subsistence economy]{.hp}

## 2nd Lowest

Not [officially]{.hi} extremely poor, but I think we would usually consider them as very poor

::: {.fragment}
- About 1.7 [B]{.hp}[illion]{.hi} people live on less than $3.65 per day
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Employment is most likely informal
- Likely get around on cheap and barely functioning vehicles
- Water may only be potable after boiling or adding chlorine 
- Possibly less hazardous cooking materials used
:::

::: {.fragment}
> Still likely suffer from [one or more components of poverty]{.hi}, although not enough to be officially classified as multidimensionally poor
:::

---

## 2nd Highest 

::: {.fragment}
- We can think of people in this strata as living on about $15 per day
    - More than 75% of the world lives at this level $\rightarrow$ we would consider them as middle income by global standards
:::

::: {.fragment}
- They will live in more urban areas
- Employment may still be informal with minimal stability
- They probably have a TV
- Have some education
:::

::: {.fragment}
> [Children]{.hi} are [likely to survive early childhood]{.hi-green}
:::

## Nuevo Zirosto, Michoacan, Mexico

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
![](images/mex-road.jpg){fig-align="center" height="550"}

::: {.column width="35%" .vertical-center}

## Highest

Close to a billion people live at this level

::: {.fragment}
[We are all here]{.hi .align-center} 
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
- Not millionaires but live comfortably
- Formal jobs, generally with some sort of labor protection
- TVs, high-speed internet, smartphones, laptops, refrigerators, dishwashers, etc.
- Food is not necessarily an issue
- Children will be healthy
    - Although obesity has rapidly become a problem 
- High life-expectancy at birth
- Live will have ups and downs but very unlikely to fall below this stratum
:::

## Movement Across Strata

It is possible to move across strata, but the probabilities are usually low

::: {.fragment .align-center}
- Usually movements will occur within levels, where individuals gain greater relative wealth

- Interestingly enough, the lower strata are generally aware of what life is within the higher levels.
- The opposite is not necessarily true
