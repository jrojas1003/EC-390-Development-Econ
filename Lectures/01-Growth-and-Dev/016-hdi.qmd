## Defining Development

Recall we have a large list of factors to possibly consider when measuring development

- What if a country has a [high life expectancy but low literacy]{.hi-green}? How can we compare that country with [high literacy but low life expectancy]{.hp}?

::: {.fragment}
We can then consider using the [Human Development Index (HDI)]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- This measures the national socioeconomic development by combining education, health, and adjusted real income per capita
- It goes from 0 (lowest human development) to 1 (highest human development)

## How is HDI Measured?

Since there are [three separate components]{.hi}, we first have to measure those.

Thankfully it is not complicated

::: {.fragment}
Each component is calculated as a ratio given by the [distance above the minimum to the maximum]{.h} level that a country has achieved

\begin{align*}
    \text{Dimension Index} = \; \dfrac{\text{Actual Value} - \text{Min Value}}{\text{Max Value} - \text{Min Value}}
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.fragment}
The dimensions used are:

- Health {{< fa arrow-right >}} Life Expectancy 
- Education {{< fa arrow-right >}} Average Years of Schooling & Expected Years of Schooling
- Income {{< fa arrow-right >}} PPP adjusted per capita GNI

## How is HDI Measured?

Once we have these values, we calculate the [HDI]{.hi} using a [geometric mean]{.hi}

- This allows for imperfect substitution between the factors when measuring economic development of countries

::: {.fragment}
- The formula is then:

\begin{align*}
    HDI = H^{1/3}E^{1/3}I^{1/3} 
\end{align*}

Where:

[$H =$ Health Index $\;\;\;\;\; E =$ Education Index $\;\;\;\;\; I =$ Income Index]{.align-center}

## HDI - Interpreting the Value

After having obtained all [3 individual indices]{.hi} and calculated the [HDI]{.hi}, we get a number between 0 and 1

The most recent classifications are:

::: {.fragment}
- Low Human Development (< 0.550)
- Medium Human Development (0.550 - 0.699)
- High Human Development (0.700 - 0.799)
- Very High Human Development ($\geq$ 0.800)
