## Convergence and Divergence of Countries

Are living standards in developing countries [converging]{.hi-green} to developed countries?
Or [diverging]{.hp}?

::: {.incremental}
- [Convergence:]{.hi-green} Tendency for per capita income (or output) to grow faster in lower-income countries than in higher-income countries
    - Low-income countries are ["catching up"]{.hi-green}
- [Divergence:]{.hp} A tendency of per capita income (or output) to grow faster in higher-income countries than in lower-income countries
    - High-income countries are ["pulling away"]{.hp}

## Relative vs Absolute Convergence

- [Relative Convergence:]{.hi} Are developed countries growing at a faster rate than developed countries?

::: {.fragment}
- It is easier to grow at lower levels of wealth
- There are higher returns to small increases in productivity, wealth, etc.
- Because of this, the [relative gap]{.hi} between developing and developed countries would shrink
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Poorer countries are cathing up, but not necessarily matching richer countries
:::

## Relative vs Absolute Convergence

- [Absolute Convergence:]{.hi} Is the [absolute gap]{.h} between developing and developed countries shrinking?

::: {.fragment}
- Even if incomes are growing at a faster rate in poorer countries, [real incomes]{.hi} could be increasing more in developed countries
- Developed countries would remain ahead
- [Absolute convergence]{.hi} implies that they will equalize at some point 
    - Highly unlikely to happen
:::

::: {.fragment}
- It is possible to have relative convergence without absolute convergence
- However, if there is absolute convergence, then there will be relative convergence as well

## Calculating Convergence

We will use incomes to measure convergence (not perfect but it does the job).
Additionally, we will look at growth rates of incomes.

::: {.fragment}
- Say that we have two countries, A and B.

[Measure growth as:]{.hi .align-center}

\begin{align*}
    \text{Growth Rate} = \dfrac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}}
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
[Country A]{.hi .align-center}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Growth Rate} = 41.6\%
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
[Country B]{.hi .align-center}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Growth Rate} = 11.11\%

- Average incomes in South Asia and China are growing at a [faster rate]{.hi} than those in high-income OECD countries (56% and 196% vs 24%)
    - There is evidence of [relative country convergence]{.hi-green}
- The [absolute increase in incomes]{.hi} is lower in South Asia and China than in high-income OECD countries (About $1,000 and $2,500 vs $4,000)
    - This is evidence [against]{.hp} [absolute country convergence]{.hi}
