## How Can We Classify Nations?

An imperfect way we use is by their [GNI per capita]{.hi} levels

This creates 4 classifications:

::: {.fragment}
- [_Low-Income Countries (LICs)_]{.hi .note}
- [_Lower-Middle-Income Countries (LMCs)_]{.hi .note}
- [_Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMCs)_]{.hi .note}
- [_High-Income Countries (HICs)_]{.hi .note}

## Movements Are Clearly Possible

All it takes is a higher [GNI per capita]{.hi} level

::: {.fragment}
- GNI, as we saw, is simply a measure of income for the country {{< fa arrow-right >}} It can increase or decrease
- Per Capita means per person {{< fa arrow-right >}} Populations can shift for many reasons
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
But achieving a higher income status does not necessarily eliminate the "developing country" tag

::: {.incremental}
- Say a country achieves a high enough GNI per capita to be classified as a [HIC]{.hi}
- This country has a history of not being good at managing debt or a weak financial system
- This country is highly susceptible to dropping in income
    - Because it's probably happened before
