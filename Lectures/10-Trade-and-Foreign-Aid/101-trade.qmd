- Exports increased from [19 Billion USD in 1970]{.hi} to [270 Billion USD in 1989]{.hp}

## Trade and Growth

- More recently, [China's economy]{.hi} has grown substantially and many economists point to their emphasis on trade as a main cause

## Winners and Losers

- Economists like to argue that [trade results in the most efficient allocation of production]{.hi}

    - Goods are produced where costs are lower

::: {.incremental}
- In general, this results in lower prices for consumers and increased welfare
- However, benefits are not distributed equally across the population
- If the US imports cars from Japan, what happens to US auto workers?
- [In theory]{.hi}, those that ["lose"]{.hp} from trade could be compensated by those that ["win"]{.hi-green}
- [In practice]{.hi}, that does not happen
