## Sharecropping

[Definition:]{.h} A form of agriculture in which a landowner allows a tenant to use the land in return for a share of the crops produced on their portion of land

::: {.fragment .vertical-center}
- Popular form of agriculture in many parts of the world
- [Risk-aversion]{.hi} helps explain why we observe it so frequently, even though it is inefficient
- To understand why, we need to think about the [incentives of the farmer and landlord]{.hi}

## Optimal Labor

If a farmer is working on their own plot of land, they will decide the optimal amount of hours to work

::: {.fragment}
[But how?]{.hp .align-center}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- By finding where [marginal product of labor]{.hi} equals the [value of the next best alternative]{.h} [Why?]{.hp .fragment}
    - If $VPML < \text{Opportunity Cost}$, then the farmer should [stop working and do something else]{.hi}
    - If $VPML > \text{Opportunity Cost}$, then the farmer should [work more and dedicate themselves to this work]{.hi-green}
- Because of this, there is [clearly one optimal labor amount]{.hi}

## Sharecropping Impact

Suppose the farmer [does not own the farm]{.hp}

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- Further suppose that the [farmer only gets to keep 60% of the VMPL]{.hi}
- They give up [40% of their yield]{.hi} to the farm owner as a form of payment

## Sharecropping Impact

## Sharecropping Impact

Which leaves the awkward space known as [deadweight loss from sharecropping]{.hii}

## Sharecropping Impact

::: {.align-center}
[The existence of]{.h} [Deadweight Loss]{.hii} [means that it is inefficient]{.h}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- But if it is [inefficient]{.h}, why do we observe it in the world?
- Let's think of the other alternatives:
    - The [landlord]{.hi-red} pays the [farmer]{.hi-green} a [wage]{.hi} to farm the land
    - The [farmer]{.hi-green} pays the [landlord]{.hi-red} a [fixed-rent]{.hi} to lease the land
:::

---

## Are the Alternatives Better?

::: {.align-center}
[Landlord]{.hi-red} [pays a]{.h} [wage]{.hi} [to the]{.h} [farmer]{.hi-green}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- The [landlord]{.hi-red} pays the [farmer]{.hi-green} but [monitoring the farmer is difficult]{.hi}
- The [farmer's]{.hi-green} income is [guaranteed]{.h}, regardless of output
- But output remains [uncertain]{.hi} due to weather, pests, etc.
- So the [landlord]{.hi-red} [bears all the risk]{.h} of low-yields or crop failure
- Even more important, the [farmer]{.hi-green} has an [incentive to neglect working]{.hi}
    - Income does not depend on output [leads to a moral hazard situation]{.hp .fragment}
:::

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[So Moral Hazard + Full risk on the landlord makes this more inefficient]{.hi}
:::

::: {.notes}
Moral hazard: the risk that one party will take more risks because another party will bear the costs of those risks
:::

---

## Are the Alternatives Better?

::: {.align-center}
[Farmer]{.hi-green} [pays a]{.h} [fixed-rent]{.hi} [to the]{.h} [landlord]{.hi-red}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- The [farmer]{.hi-green} keeps all profits from the farm (after paying the fixed-rent)
- So the [farmer]{.hi-green} bears all the [production risks]{.hi}
- If [output was low]{.hi}, the farmer may lose income or not be able to pay rent
- For a [risk-averse]{.hi} [farmer]{.hi-green}, this is very costly and makes them not want to take action
- The [landlord]{.hi-red} avoids all risk, but [the farmer's welfare suffers]{.hi}

::: {.fragment .align-center}
[Full risk being being on the farmer means that this is more inefficient]{.hi}

## Summary

::: {.align-center}
[Sharecropping is the compromise]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- If both the [landlord]{.hi-red} and the [farmer]{.hi-green} are [risk-averse]{.hi}, then share cropping is as close as we can get to efficiency
    - If the [farmer]{.hi-green} just payed [fixed rent]{.hi} to the [landlord]{.hi-red}, the [farmer]{.hi-green} would bears all the risk of a poor crop
    - If the [landlord]{.hi-red} simply paid a [wage]{.hi} to the [farmer]{.hi-green}, the [landlord]{.hi-red} bears all the risk of a poor crop
- Sharecropping [splits both the risk and income]{.hi}
:::

::: {.notes}
This relies heavily on both agents being risk-averse. Which is a reasonable assumption given the circumstances.
