## Farming Across the World

We can juxtapose farmers in the developing world to farmers in the US, to better understand the scale of the difference

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}
[Farmers in Developing Countries]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- Very small farms {{< fa arrow-right >}} Less than 10 acres (on average)
- Less farming technology 
- Need to adapt to hotter and more humid climates
- Farmers supply food for themselves

::: {.column width=50%}
[Farmers in the US]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- Farms are large {{< fa arrow-right >}} 441 acres (on average)
- Farming technology is highly advanced 
- Technology is well-aligned with local climates
- Farmers supply food for many people {{< fa arrow-right >}} 144 people per farmer (on average)

10 acres is about 1.5 Autzens

440 acres is about 1.5 of campus

## Malthusian Trap

Malthus (1789) argued that population growth would lead to mass shortages of food

::: {.fragment}
- This is thought to describe how [population growth tends to outpace the growth of resources]{.hi}
- This was called the "Malthusian Trap" or Malthusian Theory of Population

## Malthusian Trap

Assumptions used for this argument:

::: {.incremental .vertical-center}
- Population grows exponentially [(1, 4, 9, 16,...)]{.hi}
- [Diminishing returns]{.hp} to land, labor, capital, etc. means that [resources]{.hi} grow linearly [(1,2,3,4,...)]{.hi}
- There exists a limit to the amount of food that can be produced
- So there is a [carrying capacity]{.h} due to the food supply limit
:::

::: {.notes}
Carrying capacity is the maximum population size that an environment can sustain indefinitely, given the available resources (like food, water, and space) and the technology available to use them.

## Malthusian Trap

The assumptions are relatively true, but still we don't see any [Malthusian Trap]{.hp}
