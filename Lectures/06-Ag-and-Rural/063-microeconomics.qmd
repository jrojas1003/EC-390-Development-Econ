## Microeconomics of Farming

[Classical Theory]{.hi} has [two factor models of production]{.hp} where [capital is fixed]{.h}, but [labor is variable]{.h}

::: {.incremental}
- Households can adjust how much they work on their farm, but not what tools they use
- Gives rationale for [low productivity]{.h} 
- [Does not]{.hp} explain why small farm owners are resistant to technological innovation
- Theory says they will choose the method of production that gives the [lowest cost]{.h}
- Also implies [perfect knowledge]{.hi} of types of technology, needed inputs, the weather, etc.

## Microeconomics of Farming 

[The problem is that classical theory of agricultural production does not consider farmer's uncertainty]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
Which would you prefer?
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[10 dollars with certainty]{.hi .align-center .fragment}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[50% chance of getting 30 dollars and 50% chance of paying 10 dollars]{.hi .align-center .fragment}
:::

::::

::: {.incremental}
- Both have the same [expected payoff]{.hi}
- But the [first]{.hi} has more [consistent outcomes]{.hi}
- People tend to be [risk-averse]{.hp}
    - Do not like uncertaincty/variance in their outcomes

## Microeconomics of Farming

Take the following [farming techniques]{.hi}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Technique A]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- Offers a [lower average yield]{.hi}
- Low variance
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Technique B]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- Offers a [higher average yield]{.hi}
- Higher variance

## Microeconomics of Farming

But we are leaving potential higher yields on the table

::: {.incremental}
- [Crop insurance]{.hi} helps with this problem
    - This can be an [actual insurance policy]{.hi}
- This would mean that [farmers get paid]{.h} when they have [low yield]{.hp}
- Alternatively, diversification of crops can work as insurance
    - Farmers would still have some y ield even if one crop does not work out
- The goal is to [allow farmers to take risks]{.hi}

## Microeconomics of Farming

Let's do math

::: {.incremental}
- Consider my crop yield is $X$ and my neighbor's is $Y$
- If I rely on my own crops, I get $E[X]$ on average with a variance of $Var(X)$
- If my neighbor and I [share our yields]{.h} we each get:
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
$$
    \dfrac{E[X] + E[Y]}{2}
$$

on average with a variance of
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
$$
    Var\left(\dfrac{X + Y}{2}\right) = 0.25 * Var(X) + 0.25 * Var(Y) + 0.5 * Cov(X,Y)
$$
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
$$
    \text{We can get this from:} \; Var(aX + bY) = a^{2}Var(X) + b^{2}Var(Y) + 2ab Cov(X,Y)
$$
:::

---

## Covariance

::: {.small}
$$
   Var\left(\dfrac{X + Y}{2}\right) = 0.25 * Var(X) + 0.25 * Var(Y) + 0.5 * Cov(X,Y)
$$
:::

::: {.incremental}
- The last term in the equation is very important
- [Covariance]{.hi} is a measure of [joint variability]{.hi}
    - When [variables behave similarly]{.hi-green}, we call that [positive covariance]{.hi-green}
    - When [variables behave dissimilarly]{.hi-red}, we call that [negative covariance]{.hi-red}
- An example is the daily temperature and how sunny it is
    - We should suspect that when it is sunny, the temperature is also high
    - This would lead us to think that the sun and temperature have a [positive covariance]{.hi-green}
:::

## Covariance in our Farming Example

$$
   Var\left(\dfrac{X + Y}{2}\right) = 0.25 * Var(X) + 0.25 * Var(Y) + 0.5 * Cov(X,Y)
$$

Imagine you and your neighbor are growing crops

::: {.fragment}
- You share a common goal: to produce a high amount of consistent food
- What should you and your neighbor do to accomplish this?
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Grow crops that have a [negative covariance]{.hi-red}
- This would be a form of insurance (informal insurance)

## Consumption Smoothing

[Definition:]{.h} Maintaining a consistent level of consumption over time

::: {.incremental}
- Why might the goal be to maintain a consistent level of consumption?
    - We prefer to maintain a stable standard of living over time
- How do we consumption smooth?
    - Savings accounts, social security, [insurance]{.hi}, etc.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- If a farmer has a really bad year, insurance kicks in and helps maintain consumption levels
- But in many developing countries, saving is difficult and there is no formal insurance
- What can individuals do?
