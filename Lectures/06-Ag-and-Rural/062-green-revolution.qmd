## [Green Revolution]{.hi-green} [$\leftarrow$ I made it green]{.fragment .hi-green}

::: {.fragment}
Boost in grain production associated with the [scientific discovery of new hybrid-seed varieties]{.hi} of wheat, rice, and corn that resulted in high yields in many developing countries

[Key Elements]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- [High-yield crop varieties]{.h}
- [Chemical fertilizers and pesticides]{.h}
- [Irrigation expansion]{.h}
- [Modern farming techniques]{.h}
:::

::: {.fragment}
[New Seeds]{.h}

- Resistance to drought and pests
- Give higher yields

## Agrarian Systems in Developing Countries

There are [different agricultural practices]{.hi} in developing economies

::: {.fragment .vertical-center}
We can think of three separate stages

[_1._]{.hp .note} [Agriculture-based countries]{.hp}

[_2._]{.hp .note} [Transforming countries]{.hp}

[_3._]{.hp .note} [Urbanized countries]{.hp}

## [_1._]{.hp .note} Agriculture-Based Countries

- About 417 Million people live here

::: {.incremental}
- More than 66% of the poor in these countries live in [rural areas]{.h}
- Agriculture accounts for 32% of GDP growth (on average)
- Rely heavily on [traditional agricultural practices]{.hi}
    - ["Slash-and-Burn"]{.hp} [{{< fa arrow-right >}} No Bueno]{.hp .fragment}
:::

## Slash-and-Burn

[Rotating plots of land]{.hi}

Here is the process:

::: {.incremental}
- Remove trees and vegetation
- Burn the area (increases nutrients in the soil)
- Plant crops directly into nutrient-rich ash
- Cultivate until plot becomes [infertile]{.hp}
- Abandoment and fallow
:::

::: {.fragment}
Very old agricultural process and it is not very efficient if you are not moving around the world

- Also leads to [deforestation and erosion]{.hp}
:::

::: {.notes}
Infertility happens after maybe 2-3 years, depending on land use

Plot is left alone and let to grown on its own (fallow period)
:::

## [_2._]{.hp .note} Transforming Countries

- Largest concentration of people living in a rural setting (2.2 Billion)

::: {.fragment}
[As the name implies, its a transition toward urbanization]{.hi}
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Rural poverty is high, but agriculture contributes about 7% to GDP growth
- [Labor]{.h} begins to move out of agriculture and into other sectors [(manufacturing, services, and construction)]{.h}
- [Urbanization]{.hi} accelerates as people migrate to cities for jobs
- Potential for [income growth]{.h} 
    - Increased probability of [income inequality]{.hp}
:::

---

## [_3._]{.hp .note} Urbanized Countries

- Half or more than the country's poor live in cities

::: {.incremental}
- Very few working people are in the agricultural sector
- Agriculture contributes even less to GDP growth 
- Typically will find an industrial agricultural sector (US)
- Typically countries with large urban centers
- [Technological innovation and human capital drive growth]{.hi}

## Problems in Agricultural Development

As with everything, there are issues of inequality

::: {.small}
- Here we are talking about [inequality in land holdings]{.hp} (specially in LATAM)
:::

::: {.incremental}
- [Huge]{.h} farms employ many people
    - However, [land owners]{.hp} care more about [maintaining market power]{.hp} than increasing output
- Medium sized farmers are rare
    - Farms these size potentially have a better mix of capital and labor, are more productive, have lower transaction costs than larger farms
- Some very small farms
    - These are household farms
    - Because they are small, there are [no economies of scale]{.hi}

## Land GINI

## Problems in Agricultural Development

[Subdivision of land in Asia]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Pre-colonial Asian cultures prefer cooperation, [sharing resources]{.hi} within villages
- [Colonial institutions]{.hp} assigned property rights to land
- Most [landlords live elsewhere]{.hp}, and rely on [sharecroppers]{.h} to produce agricultural goods
    - [Sharecroppers:]{.h} Renter farmers, which kickback a percentage of the crops in exchange for lease of the land
- [Land is scarce]{.hp}, so rents are high
- At the same time, [labor is abundance]{.hi}, so wages are low

## Problems in Agricultural Development

[Subsistence farming in Africa]{.hi}

::: {.incremental .small}
- Most farming takes place on small plots to produce for one family
- Three main reasons for this persistence:
    - Most farming is done by individuals using [traditional tools]{.hi}
    - Farming usually involves shifting cultivation once land nutrients have been used
    - Leads to inefficencies since individuals must wait for nutrients to replenish
- This causes large swings in employment
    - [During farming times]{.hi}, labor is scarce
    - [During non-farming times]{.hi}, labor is in excess
- It is hard to sustain populations with the amount of food grown in these economies
