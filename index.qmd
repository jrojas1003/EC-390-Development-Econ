## Announcement Box
Welcome to EC 390! 

This is where **everything** in our course lives. 
Please explore the site (and let me know if something is broken).

This space (literally this box) is where I will post timely announcements. 
I will also make them on Canvas so that you receive an actual notification, but you should be checking this website often. 

We will use Canvas as a glorified assignment submission space and gradebook. 
In short, you'll submit assignments there and see your grades there.
